Example: ARM sys dev guide 14.10

We use seven steps to set up the MMU for the demonstration:
1. Define the fixed system software regions; this fixed area is shown in Figure 14.5.
2. Define the three virtual memory maps for the three tasks; the general layout of these
maps is shown in Figure 14.4.
3. Locate the regions listed in steps 1 and 2 into the physical memory map; this is an
implementation of what is shown on the right side of Figure 14.5.
4. Define and locate the page tables within the page table region.
5. Define the data structures needed to create and manage the regions and page tables.
These structures are implementation dependent and are defined specifically for the
example. However, the general form of the structures is a good starting point for most
simple systems.
6. Initialize the MMU, caches, and write buffer.
7. Set up a context switch routine to gracefully transition from one task to the next.
